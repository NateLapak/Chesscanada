# Chesscanada.ca
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> Chesscanada is an open-source chess website whose purpose is to build and grow the chess community inside of Canada. Built using the Lichess api, this website can be used to chat, play and analyse chess games primarily with other canadians. Chesscanada is primarily focused on high school and university students within Canada, but is open to casual players as well. </p>

<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> I wanted to create my first full-stack website and i've always wanted to try and create a chess website. I needed more experience and backend knowledge before I could tackle this project, but now I believe I have the skillset and previous web development experience to develop a project this big. Once I deploy the project, I will continue to expand and improve the website as well.</p>
