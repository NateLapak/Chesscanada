# Chesscanada
<h2> Overview </h2>
Chesscanada is a full stack website created using Flask and React. Similar to websites like chess.com and lichess, Chesscanada's purpose is to build and grow the chess community inside of Canada. This website can be used to chat, play and analyse chess games primarily with other canadians. Chesscanada is primarily focused on high school and university students within Canada, but is open to casual players as well.
